We have a documentation repository with these pipeline directories:
$(printf '%s\n' "${pipeline_dirs[@]}")

Write a concise, direct README in Markdown for the root of this repository. 
Use ONLY relative paths like `docs/bbr-backup/` and avoid absolute paths. 
Begin with a header like '# Repository Overview' or similar. 
Explain each pipeline's overall purpose and how they fit into an automation or platform workflow. 
Reference the folder structure under docs/ for each pipeline. 
Offer a short best-practice or recommendation for how to navigate these docs.

IMPORTANT: 
 - Do not add disclaimers or meta statements like 'Here is an example:' or 'Here is the solution:'. 
 - Do not include absolute paths. 
 - Simply provide the final README in Markdown, with headings, bullet points, or code blocks as needed.
